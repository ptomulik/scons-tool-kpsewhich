scons-tool-kpsewhich
====================

This tool provides `SCons`_ with interface to kpsewhich utility. The kpsewhich
program is a part of `kpathsea`_ library, which in turn is a part of TeX Live
distribution. Its purpose is to search within the `TeX directory structure`_
(TDS) for files such as TeX classes, styles, BibTeX databases, fonts etc. For
more informations see `kpathsea manual`_ and informations about `TeX directory
structure`_ (TDS).

This tool appends new methods to the SCons Environment. It does not provide any
builders, but rather equips SCons Environment with methods that call
``kpsewhich`` program during the SConscript-reading phase. This tool does not
produce any files, it is thought as an extension for obtaining textual
information from external program.

INSTALLATION
------------

Copy the ``kpathsea.py`` file to your project's ``site_scons/site_tools/``
(per-project installation) or to ``~/.scons/site_scons/site_tools/`` (per user
installation). See SCons manual for details about installation of tools.

USAGE EXAMPLES
--------------

Find files ``article.cls`` and ``amsmath.sty`` used by ``latex``::

    env = Environment(tools = ['tex', 'kpsewhich'])
    files = env.KPSFindFiles(['article.cls','amsmath.sty'], progname='$LATEX')

Find all occurrences of ``unicode.sty`` file in TDS::

    env = Environment(tools = ['kpsewhich'])
    files = env.KPSFindAllFiles('unicode.sty')

Other functions (correspond directly to ``kpsewhich`` function options)::

    texmf = env.KPSExpandBraces('a{b,c}d')# kpsewhich -expand-braces 'a{b,c}d'
    texmf = env.KPSExpandPath('$TEXMF')   # kpsewhich -expand-path '$TEXMF'
    texmf = env.KPSExpandVar('$TEXMF')    # kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMF'
    texpath = env.KPSShowPath('tex')      # kpsewhich -show-path 'tex'
    home = env.KPSVarValue('TEXMFHOME')   # kpsewhich -var-value 'TEXMFHOME'



CONSTRUCTION VARIABLES
``````````````````````

The following construction variables may be used to configure the ``kpsewhich``
tool. They may be also provided as keyword arguments to ``KPSXxx()`` methods.

============================== ==============================================
        Variable                                Description
============================== ==============================================
 ``KPSEWHICH``                    the ``kpsewhich`` executable
------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
 ``KPSEWHICHFLAGS``               additional flags to ``kpsewhich``
------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
 ``KPSVARIABLES``                 (re)define variables for ``kpsewhich``
============================== ==============================================

``KPSVARIABLES`` must be a dictionary in form ``{ NAME : VALUE }``,
for example::

  KPSVARIABLES = {"TEXMFHOME" : "/home/ptomulik/texmf"}

ARGUMENTS
`````````

These arguments are accepted by some ``KPSXxx()`` methods. All the methods accept
``progname``. All other arguments are accepted by ``KPSFindFiles`` and
``KPSFindAllFiles``.

============================== ==============================================
        Variable                                Description
============================== ==============================================
 ``dpi``                         corresponds to ``-dpi`` flag,
------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
 ``format``                      corresponds to ``-format`` flag,
------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
 ``path``                        corresponds to ``-path`` flag
------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
 ``progname``                    corresponds to ``-progname`` flag
------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
 ``subdir``                      corresponds to ``-subdir`` flag
============================== ==============================================


DOWNLOADING TEST FRAMEWORK
--------------------------

To run tests you will need the `SCons test framework`_. On GNU systems you may
quickly download it with the script ``bin/downloads.py``::

    bin/downloads.py

The development tree may be later cleaned-up from the downloaded files by::

    bin/downloads.py --clean

The script uses the `mercurial`_ VCS (hg) tools to download latest version.

If the above script does not work on your platform download the following files
from the `SCons test framework`_.

 ========================= ==================================================
  source file/directory                   target file/directory
 ========================= ==================================================
  ``QMTest/``               ``QMTest/``
 ------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  ``runtest.py``            ``runtest.py``
 ========================= ==================================================

All downloaded files are ignored from the repository by ``.gitignore``, so you
don't have to worry about deleting them before doing commits.


RUNNING TESTS
-------------

To run all the tests type::

    python runtest.py -a

This requires the presence of the testing framework in the development tree.
